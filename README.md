🧠 About the Project

Inspired by Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros, this app combines fandom fun with front-end development. Users answer a series of questions, and the app analyzes their traits to generate a personalized result: a dragon who would (hypothetically) bond with them.

🔮 Features
	•	✨ Personality-based quiz with animated transitions
	•	🐲 Custom dragon results by color and tail type
	•	🎨 Visual result page using pre-generated dragon images
	•	⚛️ Built with React + Vite
	•	🎞️ Smooth UI interactions with Framer Motion
	•	🧠 Trait-to-result logic using object mapping and frequency analysis

🧱 Built With
	•	React (with Hooks)
	•	Vite (for fast builds and dev server)
	•	Framer Motion (for animations)
	•	CSS (custom styling)
	•	JavaScript (logic-heavy trait handling)
